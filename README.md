# Maui Server: A topic indexing server based on Maui

This is work in progress on Maui Server, an HTTP wrapper around the [Maui Topic Indexer](https://github.com/zelandiya/maui).

Maui Server provides a topic indexing service. It automatically determines the main topics of a text, with candidate topics coming from a [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) vocabulary. It requires training data--documents with previously assigned topics--to work. Maui Server is a Java web application an provides RESTful, JSON-based APIs.
